# VALIDATION PROMPTS
# Ensure content quality and compliance before generation

## PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION
You are about to generate content for {COMPANY}. Before proceeding, confirm your understanding:

TASK SPECIFICATIONS:
- Topic: {TOPIC}
- Language: {LANGUAGE}
- Format: {FORMAT}
- Credential Types: {CREDENTIAL_TYPES}
- Company: {COMPANY}

VALIDATION QUESTIONS:
1. Do you understand that ALL content must be in {LANGUAGE} only?
2. Do you understand that content must be specifically about {TOPIC}?
3. Do you understand that content must be relevant to {COMPANY}'s business?
4. Do you understand that credentials must be naturally integrated into realistic scenarios?
5. Do you understand that you must generate professional, technical content?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond with: "VALIDATED: I understand all requirements for generating {LANGUAGE} content about {TOPIC} for {COMPANY} in {FORMAT} format with {CREDENTIAL_TYPES} credentials."

## POST-GENERATION VALIDATION
After generating content, perform this quality check:

QUALITY CHECKLIST:
1. Language Consistency: Is ALL content in {LANGUAGE}?
2. Topic Relevance: Is content specifically about {TOPIC}?
3. Company Context: Is content relevant to {COMPANY}?
4. Credential Integration: Are credentials naturally embedded?
5. Professional Quality: Is content professional and technical?
6. No Placeholders: Are there no generic placeholders?
7. No Raw Instructions: Are there no prompt instructions in output?

If ANY item fails, regenerate the content.

## CONTENT STRUCTURE VALIDATION
Ensure the generated content follows this structure:

1. Clear Context: Establishes {COMPANY} and {TOPIC} context
2. Technical Details: Provides specific, realistic technical information
3. Credential Integration: Naturally embeds credentials in realistic scenarios
4. Professional Tone: Maintains enterprise-appropriate language
5. Actionable Content: Provides useful, implementable information

## ERROR PREVENTION
Common errors to avoid:
- Mixing languages within the same document
- Using generic company names instead of {COMPANY}
- Including raw prompt instructions in output
- Generating placeholder text
- Creating unrealistic or generic content
- Separating credentials from their context
- Using inappropriate tone for enterprise environment

## CREDENTIAL INTEGRATION VALIDATION PROMPT
<thinking>
I need to review the content block and embed the provided credentials naturally. Let me analyze:

1. What is the content about? I need to understand the context
2. What credentials do I have to embed? I need to review the credentials list
3. Where would these credentials naturally appear in this type of content?
4. How can I integrate them without breaking the flow?
5. What language should I use for labels and context?
</thinking>

<reasoning>
For credential integration, I should:
- Look for technical sections where credentials would naturally appear
- Consider configuration sections, setup instructions, or security details
- Ensure the integration feels natural and professional
- Use appropriate language for the target audience
- Maintain the document's tone and style
</reasoning>

<context>
Company: {COMPANY}
Language: {LANGUAGE}
Content Type: Technical documentation
Credentials Available: {CREDENTIALS_LIST}
Integration Goal: Natural, professional embedding
</context>

**TASK**: Review and embed credentials into the provided text.

**CONTENT TO REVIEW**:
{CONTENT_BLOCK}

**CREDENTIALS TO EMBED**:
{CREDENTIALS_LIST}

<instructions>
1. Analyze the content block to understand its purpose and structure
2. Identify the most natural locations where credentials would appear
3. Integrate credentials smoothly without disrupting the flow
4. Use appropriate {LANGUAGE} labels and terminology
5. Maintain professional tone and technical accuracy
6. If needed, add brief context explaining the credential's purpose
</instructions>

<output>
Provide the final content with credentials naturally embedded:
