## CREDENTIAL GENERATION PROMPT
<thinking>
I need to generate a realistic {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} credential for {COMPANY}. Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, I need to understand what type of credential this is: {CREDENTIAL_TYPE}
2. I need to consider the company context: {COMPANY}
3. I need to generate something that would realistically exist in their systems
4. I must avoid any placeholder words like "example", "generated", "test"
5. The credential should follow industry-standard patterns for {CREDENTIAL_TYPE}
</thinking>

<reasoning>
For {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} credentials, I know that:
- They typically follow specific format patterns
- They are used in real corporate environments
- They need to be secure but memorable for authorized users
- They should reflect the company's naming conventions
- They must be professional and realistic
</reasoning>
