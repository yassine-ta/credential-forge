# CREDENTIAL GENERATION PROMPTS
# These prompts use regex database information for dynamic credential generation

## CREDENTIAL GENERATION PROMPT
Generate a {DESCRIPTION} for {COMPANY}.

Type: {CREDENTIAL_TYPE}
Pattern: {REGEX_PATTERN}
Description: {DESCRIPTION}
Example: {EXAMPLE}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. The credential MUST match this exact regex pattern: {REGEX_PATTERN}
2. Generate ONLY the credential value - no explanations, no extra text, no quotes
3. Make it realistic and professional for {COMPANY}
4. Ensure it's suitable for production use
5. Follow the format shown in the example

Generate the {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} now:

## CREDENTIAL VALIDATION PROMPT
<thinking>
I need to validate that the generated credential meets all requirements:

1. Does it match the regex pattern {REGEX_PATTERN}?
2. Is it appropriate for {COMPANY}?
3. Is it relevant to {TOPIC}?
4. Is it realistic and professional?
5. Does it follow {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} standards?
</thinking>

<validation_rules>
The generated credential must:
✓ Match regex pattern: {REGEX_PATTERN}
✓ Be appropriate for {COMPANY}
✓ Be relevant to {TOPIC}
✓ Be realistic and professional
✓ Follow {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} standards
✓ Be in {LANGUAGE} if applicable
✓ Not contain placeholder words
✓ Not be obviously fake or test data
</validation_rules>

## BATCH CREDENTIAL GENERATION PROMPT
<thinking>
I need to generate multiple {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} credentials for {COMPANY} in the context of {TOPIC}. Each credential must:

1. Match the regex pattern {REGEX_PATTERN}
2. Be unique and different from others
3. Be appropriate for {COMPANY}'s {TOPIC} implementation
4. Be realistic and professional
5. Follow industry standards
</thinking>

<batch_instructions>
Generate {COUNT} unique {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} credentials for {COMPANY}'s {TOPIC} implementation.

Each credential must:
- Match regex pattern: {REGEX_PATTERN}
- Be unique and different from the others
- Be appropriate for {COMPANY}
- Be relevant to {TOPIC}
- Be realistic and professional
- Follow {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} standards

Generate {COUNT} credentials now, one per line:
</batch_instructions>

## CONTEXT-AWARE CREDENTIAL GENERATION PROMPT
<thinking>
I need to generate a {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} credential that is specifically tailored for {COMPANY}'s {TOPIC} implementation. The credential should:

1. Match the regex pattern {REGEX_PATTERN}
2. Reflect {COMPANY}'s business context
3. Be appropriate for {TOPIC} use case
4. Be realistic for their industry and scale
5. Follow their likely naming conventions
</thinking>

<context_analysis>
Company: {COMPANY}
Industry: {INDUSTRY}
Company Size: {COMPANY_SIZE}
Topic: {TOPIC}
Use Case: {USE_CASE}
Credential Type: {CREDENTIAL_TYPE}
Regex Pattern: {REGEX_PATTERN}
Language: {LANGUAGE}
</context_analysis>

<contextual_instructions>
Generate a {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} credential that is specifically tailored for {COMPANY}'s {TOPIC} implementation.

Consider:
- {COMPANY}'s industry: {INDUSTRY}
- {COMPANY}'s size: {COMPANY_SIZE}
- The specific use case: {USE_CASE}
- The topic context: {TOPIC}
- The required pattern: {REGEX_PATTERN}

The credential should look like it was created specifically for {COMPANY}'s {TOPIC} project, not a generic example.

Generate the contextually appropriate {CREDENTIAL_TYPE} credential now:
