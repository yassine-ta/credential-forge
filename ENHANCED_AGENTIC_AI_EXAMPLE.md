# ðŸš€ Enhanced Agentic AI File Generation - Complete Example

## âœ… Enhanced Features Implemented

### 1. **Variable Credential Count (1-10 per file)**
- Each generated file now contains **1-10 credentials** randomly
- Credentials are selected from available types with variety
- Realistic distribution across different credential types

### 2. **Realistic Professional Content**
- **Comprehensive templates** with detailed technical information
- **Professional formatting** with proper structure
- **Real-world metrics** and configuration details
- **Multi-section documents** with executive summaries

### 3. **Multiple Topic Support**

- **Intelligent topic combination** for comprehensive documents
- **Format-specific content organization** for different file types

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Multiple Topics with Variable Credentials

```python
from credentialforge.agents.orchestrator import OrchestratorAgent

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = OrchestratorAgent()

# Configuration with multiple topics
config = {
    'output_dir': './output',
    'formats': ['docx', 'xlsx', 'pdf'],
    'credential_types': ['aws_access_key', 'api_key', 'jwt_token', 'database_connection'],
    'topics': [
        'security audit, compliance review',
        'database migration, performance optimization',
        'API documentation, monitoring setup',
        'system architecture, deployment procedures'
    ],
    'num_files': 5,
    'embed_strategy': 'random'
}

# Generate files
results = orchestrator.generate_files(config)
```

### Example 2: Interactive Mode with Enhanced Features

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Credential Generation (1-10 per file)
```python
# In orchestrator.py
num_credentials = random.randint(1, 10)
credentials = []

for i in range(num_credentials):
    cred_type = random.choice(credential_types)
    credential = self.credential_generator.generate_credential(cred_type)
    credentials.append(credential)
```

### Multiple Topic Handling
```python
# In topic_generator.py
if ',' in topic:
    topics = [t.strip() for t in topic.split(',')]
    content = self._generate_combined_topics(topics, file_format, context)
```

### Realistic Content Templates
- **Email templates**: Professional business communication format
- **Excel templates**: Comprehensive configuration spreadsheets
- **PDF templates**: Technical documentation with chapters
- **PowerPoint templates**: Multi-slide presentations
- **Word templates**: Structured technical documents

## ðŸ“Š Generated File Statistics

### Example Output for 10 Files:
```
Generated Files Summary:
- Total files: 10
- Total credentials: 47 (average 4.7 per file)
- Credential distribution:
  - aws_access_key: 12
  - api_key: 15
  - jwt_token: 8
  - database_connection: 12
- Topics covered: 15 unique topics
- Formats generated: docx, xlsx, pdf, png
- Content quality: Professional grade
```

### File Examples:
1. `docx_security_audit_database_migration_20240115_143022_1234.docx` (7 credentials)
2. `xlsx_api_documentation_monitoring_setup_20240115_143023_5678.xlsx` (3 credentials)
3. `pdf_system_architecture_deployment_20240115_143024_9012.pdf` (9 credentials)
4. `png_compliance_review_20240115_143025_3456.png` (2 credentials)
5. `docx_performance_optimization_20240115_143026_7890.docx` (5 credentials)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

1. **Realistic Testing Data**: Professional-grade documents suitable for security testing
2. **Variable Complexity**: Files with 1-10 credentials provide diverse test scenarios
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple topics create realistic multi-faceted documents
4. **Professional Quality**: Content that looks like real business documents
5. **Scalable Generation**: Can generate hundreds of files with varied content

## ðŸš€ Usage in Security Testing

The enhanced system now generates documents that are:
- **Indistinguishable from real documents** in appearance and content
- **Suitable for credential detection testing** with 1-10 embedded credentials
- **Comprehensive in scope** covering multiple business topics
- **Professional in quality** with proper formatting and structure
- **Varied in complexity** providing diverse test scenarios

This makes CredentialForge an ideal tool for:
- Security awareness training
- Credential detection system testing
- Document analysis tool validation
- Compliance testing scenarios
- Penetration testing exercises
